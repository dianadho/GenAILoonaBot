Question,Response
Is it safe to take two pills in one day?,"Yes, it’s absolutely safe to take two pills in one day, including taking two pills at once. That said, the most effective and best way to take your birth control pill is to take one every day (and if you’re taking the mini-pill, it’s extra important to take it at the same time every day). Regularly taking more than one pill a day won’t make your birth control more effective.

However, if you miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember, even if that means it’s at the same time as your next regularly scheduled dose. You might feel nauseated if you have to do this, especially if you need to take two pills at once, so take your pills with food."
Can I get pregnant from anal sex?,"No. You cannot get pregnant from anal sex. For a pregnancy to occur, semen has to be in the vagina, which is near the uterus. The butt is not connected to the vagina, so there’s no way for sperm to meet an egg. If the semen comes out of the anus and (somehow) gets on to your vulva and into your vagina, then you could get pregnant, but it’s unlikely. That being said, you can get STIs from anal sex so using a condom is still a really good idea."
How soon can I get pregnant after my implant is taken out?,"There may be a delay, but don’t count on it—many women get pregnant soon after stopping the implant, so if that’s not what you want, make sure to start a different method immediately after getting your implant removed. Depending on your body, it can take up to two months to get back to your regular cycle after having the implant removed."
How effective is withdrawal at preventing pregnancy?,"If your partner pulls out perfectly every single time, then withdrawal is about 96% effective. This is a hard method to get perfect, though, so it’s more likely that withdrawal will be around 78% effective.

Of those women who use withdrawal exactly as directed, about 4 in 100 will experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year they use this method.

Of those women who do not use withdrawal exactly as directed, about 22 in 100 will experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year they use this method.

"
Can I get pregnant with my clothes on?,"No. Dry humping cannot lead to pregnancy. Since sperm cannot swim through clothing, getting pregnant while clothed (and that, of course, means while wearing clothing that prevents penetration—a mini-skirt pulled up around your waist doesn’t count!) would be very unlikely. Sperm exposed to air lose their ability to swim and can only live a few hours or less. Wearing or touching clothes with dry semen cannot lead to pregnancy."
I'm traveling to a different time zone. How can I figure out when to take my pill?,"Basically you need to figure out what time it is in your home time zone and take it at that time. For example, if you live in Washington, DC, and you travel to Spain, which is 6 hours ahead, you should take your pill 6 hours later in the day than you normally would. So if you take your pill at 9AM in DC, you should take it at 3PM in Spain.

If you use our pill reminder system, you’re good to go while traveling; we’ll always send the reminder based on your home time zone.

If you remember your pill by setting an alarm on your phone, however, make sure to adjust it as needed when you’re on the road. If it’s easier (for example, if your usual pill time falls in the middle of the night wherever you’re visiting), you can change your schedule, as long as you don’t go more than 24 hours without a pill. So, if you live in DC and you go to Spain and want to stay on a 9AM schedule, it’s totally fine to take your next pill at 9AM Spanish time (18 hours after your last East Coast pill). But if you’re taking a progestin-only pill (also called the mini pill), the rules are different. You need to take it within 3 hours of your normal time or you’ve missed that dose. So even if that means taking it late at night, you have to stick to your regular schedule.

Also, if you’re traveling long enough that you’ll be starting a new pack of pills while you’re gone, don’t forget to stick them in your suitcase!"
I'm spotting from the implant. What can I do to stop it?,"This is a side effect that may be hard to fix, but if you’ve only had the implant for a few months or less, it could also lessen or go away on its own. Check out our Provider Perspective “Side effect spotlight: What’s up with spotting?” for more information.

"
Can I get pregnant even if my guy has ejaculated multiple times already?,"Yes, all ejaculate, whether it’s his 1st of the day or his 10th, contains millions of sperm and it just takes one to get you pregnant."
My IUD was expelled. Should I try again?,"IUD expulsion can occur in 2-10% of people in the first year after insertion. Expulsion can be more likely for people who: 
1. Haven’t been pregnant
2. Are younger than 20 years
3. Have a history of very heavy or very painful periods (though be mindful that these are reasons doctors recommend the hormonal IUD in the first place…)
4. Had the IUD put in right after giving birth or having a 2nd trimester abortion.

A partial expulsion may mean that the IUD was not quite in the right position: it may have been too low in the uterus and just worked its way out. This could be something that happened around the time of insertion, or may be related to uterine characteristics, such as size, angle, or presence of conditions like fibroids that can cause irregular shape. For people who have an IUD expulsion, the chance of expelling a 2nd IUD may be higher—in the 20% range (up to 30% in some studies).
If you want a second IUD after the first one came out, consider asking your health care provider about inserting the 2nd IUD while using an ultrasound machine to make sure the IUD is inserted all the way to the fundus."
Can I get pregnant from oral sex?,"No. You cannot get pregnant from oral sex. For a pregnancy to occur, semen has to be in the vagina, which is near the uterus. The mouth is not connected to the vagina, so there’s no way for sperm to meet an egg. So no, swallowing semen won’t lead to pregnancy. That being said, you can get STIs from oral sex so using a condom is still a really good idea."
How painful is abortion?,"We would love to be able to tell you exactly what you can expect to feel during your abortion, but unfortunately there is no one answer to this question that will be true for everyone. Some people experience very little pain, like mild period cramps, and some people experience very intense pain, which feels more like the pain of the contractions you’d have when giving birth.

The type of abortion you have will affect how long you’re in pain for and whether or not you can be sedated during the abortion. If you’re 11 weeks (77 days) pregnant or less, you should have a choice between the abortion pill (also called medication abortion) and the abortion procedure (also called in-clinic abortion).

The other thing that may affect your decision if you’re concerned about pain is that the abortion procedure itself only takes 5 to 10 minutes, while the abortion can take several hours if you choose the abortion pill.

If you have the abortion procedure, you may have the option to be sedated with IV medication. If you have “conscious sedation” administered this way you’ll be awake but very relaxed, and the procedure should be virtually pain-free. If you have general anesthesia, which is a type of IV sedation that puts you to sleep completely, you won’t feel or experience anything during the procedure—you’ll simply wake up when it’s over. If you’re not sedated, the painful part of the abortion will typically only last five to ten minutes. You should be offered pain medication that you can take by mouth if you’re not choosing sedation, and you may also be offered anti-anxiety medication that you can take by mouth. You will also have a numbing medication injected into your cervix."
I’m a smoker. What birth control options are best for me?,"For most people, the risk of blood clots when using the ring, the patch, or the combined birth control pill (which is the most common type of pill) is low. But smoking increases this risk. If you are over 35 and smoke 15 or more cigarettes a day, the combination pill, patch, and ring are not safe options for you. If you’re over 35 and you smoke less than 15 cigarettes a day, talk to your provider about whether these birth control methods are safe options for you. People who smoke can always use the IUD, the implant, the shot, the mini-pill (progestin-only pill), and any method that is hormone free (like condoms, for example)."
How do I check a condom wrapper for damage?,"Let’s face it, we aren’t always as nice to our condoms as we should be; we stuff them in pockets and leave them in hot cars or the bottom of our purse. That’s why before using a condom you should always check the expiration date and then give the wrapper a thorough inspection.

To make sure your condom is still intact, first press on the wrapper—you should feel a little cushion of air. If you can feel the air cushion it means that the outside of the wrapper has not been damaged or punctured. Next, while still pressing on the wrapper, feel for the slip-slide feeling of the lube. (Unfortunately this won’t work with unlubricated condoms.) When condoms are left in the heat or punctured, the lube can dry or leak out which in turn dries out the condom, weakening it and making it more likely to break in action."
Do I have to be sexually active to be on birth control?,"Nope—it makes a lot sense to be on birth control regardless of your relationship status. In fact, being on birth control when you’re single may even make you feel more in control of your reproductive health. People also have different definitions of “sexually active.” To some it may mean no sex ever for the foreseeable future; for others it may just mean not having a regular partner at the moment. Going on and off birth control every time you start or end a relationship can create a gap in protection that leaves you at risk for an unplanned pregnancy. Plus, birth control can offer some positive side effects that can be nice no matter your sexual-activity status.

"
"Is it okay to drink, use cannabis, or use other drugs before an abortion?","Avoid any substances that will alter your mental state, like alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs, on the day of your abortion. If you’ve used these substances, the health care provider may not be able to offer you pain medication or may not be able to perform your abortion at all. If you’re concerned about pain or you’re feeling anxious, many abortion providers offer pain medication and medication for anxiety. Talk to your provider in advance about what they can do for you."
Does birth control cause blood clots?,"Using a method of birth control with estrogen increases a young woman’s risk of forming a blood clot by several times, but for women who have no history of stroke, blood clots, or heart attack, and whose family members have never experienced a blood clot, the risk is still quite low. Women with a history of these medical conditions in their family have a higher risk of forming a new blood clot; adding birth control with estrogen to the mix increases that risk to an unacceptable level.

Progestin-only methods like the implant, mini-pill, the shot, and Skyla and Mirena IUDs don’t increase your risk. If you’re worried about blood clots, we recommend talking to your doctor about which birth control options are best for you."
How can birth control help an ovarian cyst?,"One of the main ways hormonal birth control prevents pregnancy is by stopping ovulation—so the egg never leaves the carton, so to speak. The pill, the patch, the ring, and the shot are most reliable at blocking ovulation, so people using these methods may have fewer ovarian cysts. If you tend to get ovarian cysts, your provider may recommend one of these methods to prevent future cysts. /The progestin-only or mini-pill has an unpredictable effect on ovulation and may lead to more cysts. These almost always disappear on their own, but if you’ve had problems with cysts in the past, the mini-pill may not be the best contraception for you.

"
Can the IUD hurt my partner?,"The IUD shouldn’t hurt your partner. You may have heard that the IUD strings can bother partners while having sex, but most partners can’t even feel the strings. If your partner can feel the strings, and that bothers them, your healthcare provider might be able to trim them. Plus, they usually soften over time."
How soon can I get pregnant after going off the shot?,"If you’re already on Depo and you’ve decided you want to get pregnant, you’re going to have to wait it out. There’s no way around it. But 12 weeks after your last injection, you’ll be ready to start trying. It may take some time, though. Sometimes it can take up to 10 months after the last shot for fertility to come back completely."
"My patch leaves a square of dark sticky stuff around it. What is it, and how do I get it off?","No need to worry, it’s most likely just bits of dust and dirt catching in the adhesive that makes the patch stay on your skin. While the patch is in place there isn’t too much you can do about it without running the risk of making the patch un-sticky. Once you take the patch off, you can try rubbing a little bit of baby oil on the marks. They should come right off with a little scrubbing."
Is it okay for me to take my own IUD out?,"You may be able to find some stories online about people removing their own IUD, but we wouldn’t recommend trying it. There just isn’t enough research at this point to know if it’s safe.

Plus, if you’re not happy with your IUD, going to your health care provider to get it removed will give you a chance to ask about other options for birth control. Or if you’re ready to get pregnant, you can talk with your provider about things you should do to prepare for a healthy pregnancy."
Is it safe to use flavored condoms for vaginal or anal sex?,"The good news: flavored condoms are amazing for oral sex and can help prevent STIs from making camp in your throat. The not-so-good news: some flavored condoms contain sugars that can create chaos down below in the form of yeast infections. So, before jumping in for some fun down south pause and read the packaging to check for added sugars."
Anything I can do so that my partner doesn't feel the ring during sex?,"Both the Annovera and the NuvaRing are designed to keep in during sex. During the three weeks (21 days) that you have the Annovera in, it’s important not to take it out. But if it ever comes out, make sure to put it back in right away. If Annovera is out of your vagina for more than two hours total during those 21 days, you will need to use a backup method of birth control for seven days after putting it back in.If you are using the NuvaRing and decide to take it out during sex during the three weeks (21 days) that you have the ring in, make sure to put it back in as soon as possible. If it’s out for more than 48 hours, you’re at risk for getting pregnant, and you’ll need to use a backup form of birth control for 7 days after putting the ring back in. If you leave the NuvaRing out for more than 48 hours during the third week of a cycle, put it back in right away. On the day when you would normally have taken the ring out (day 22 of the cycle, where day 1 is the day you put it in), take it out and put a new one in, skipping your ring-free week. If you don’t put a new one in on that day, you’ll need to use a backup form of birth control until you’ve had a ring in for 7 days in a row."
Can I use tampons with an IUD?,"As far as tampons and IUDs go, Planned Parenthood puts it like this: “Tampons and IUDs are kind of like next-door neighbors. They’re close but they live in different parts of the reproductive system. An IUD and a tampon are separated by the cervix, and don’t interfere with each other’s business.”

You should be fine as long as you are careful not to pull on the IUD strings, which you shouldn’t need to worry about too much since the string of a tampon is outside of your vagina and the strings of your IUD should be up near your cervix. (If you find that your IUD strings are anywhere near your tampon strings, you should go see your health care provider because your IUD might be expelled.)"
What should I do about skin irritation from the patch?,"Some women do experience irritation from the adhesive.
Try this: You could try moving it to another recommended spot to see if that lessens the effect. You can also put a little over the counter cortisone cream on the irritated area and it will probably get better quickly. Or, if you’ve been moving it around, try keeping it in one spot."
What should I do if I miss a pill?,"It depends on what type of pill you’re on and how far into the pill pack you are. If you’re on the combination pill, and it’s been 48 hours or less since your last pill, just take it as soon as you remember. Take the pill you missed even if that means you’re taking two at the same time. If you take two pills at once, you might feel nauseated, so try taking them with food. If it’s been more than 48 hours since your last pill, take one of the missed pills as soon as you remember, leaving the other one in the pack. Then take today’s dose at the time you normally would AND use a back-up method of birth control, like condoms, every time you have sex for the next seven days. The first week of your pills is the most important to prevent ovulation. If you miss a pill in the first week, that’s a bigger deal than a missed pill in a later week. In addition to taking your missed pill ASAP, you will also need to use a back-up method of birth control every time you have sex for the next seven days. If you’re on any brand of mini-pill (also called the progestin-only pill) besides Slynd, there are totally different rules. If you’re more than 3 hours late taking a pill during any week of your pill pack, you could get pregnant if you have unprotected sex, and you need to use a back-up method for 48 hours.
"
Is anal sex safer than vaginal sex?,"Anal sex might seem like a viable option if you’re concerned about pregnancy or losing your virginity in the traditional vaginal penetration sense; however, unprotected anal sex poses one of the highest sexually transmitted infection (STI) risks. The anal cavity is comprised of permeable mucous membranes which can provide an entry point for infection. Due to the nature of sexual activity involving the anus, small tears and cuts are common—especially if you’re not using enough lube—so, additional points of entry present infection opportunities."
Will the patch fall off?,"Patches fall off only about 5% of the time—so not very often. But if the patch falls off, no worries. You can stick the same patch back on if it’s been less than 24 hours and the patch is still sticky. Or, you can just apply a new patch.

DO NOT use bandages, tape, or adhesive to make a non-sticky patch stick. The hormones that keep you from getting pregnant are mixed with the adhesive, so if it won’t stick, it’s also not going to be effective as birth control.

Try this: Make sure you don’t use any “lotions or potions” (you know, powders, creams, medications, etc.) on your skin where you put the patch. Even moisturizing after the shower can interfere with the patch sticking."
Questions,Answers
Does your weight affect how well your birth control works?,"The effectiveness of almost all types of birth control will not be impacted by your weight. Two exceptions are the patch and emergency contraception.

For the patch, Xulane may be less effective if you weigh more than 198 pounds. Twirla, the other patch option, may be less effective at preventing pregnancy if your BMI is 25 or greater, and it should not be used at all if your BMI is 30 or greater because of decreased effectiveness and a potentially increased risk of blood clots.

When it comes to emergency contraception, over-the counter levonorgestrel-based emergency contraception, like Plan B One-Step, Next Choice One Dose, and others, may not be as effective in people who weigh 165 pounds or more. Ella, which is prescription-only emergency contraception, is equally effective in people who weigh between 165 and 194 pounds as it is in people who weigh under 165 pounds. But ella may not work as well if you weigh 195 pounds or more. The copper IUD and IUDs with 52mg of levonorgestrel (Mirena and Liletta) are the only emergency contraception options proven equally effective if you weigh 195 pounds or more. IUDs are also the most effective form of emergency contraception for everyone, regardless of weight."
What types of lube are safe to use with condoms?,"Both water-based and silicone-based lubricants are totally safe to use with latex condoms. Steer clear of oil-based lubricants (including massage oil, hand lotion, and Vaseline) that can cause condoms to break.

"
What are good methods for women with high blood pressure?,"For women with high blood pressure, methods with estrogen–the pill (except for the mini-pill), the ring, and the patch–may make their blood pressure even higher, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Fortunately there are lots of highly effective birth control options that are safe and estrogen-free like the IUD, the implant, or the shot. Talk to your doctor about your condition and what birth control is best for you."
Can I get pregnant if I have sex in a pool or hot tub?,"Yes, you can still get pregnant. The heat or chlorine in a hot tub will not kill sperm or make it more difficult for sperm to swim. Once the penis ejaculates inside the vagina—whether you are in a pool, hot tub, or romantic, candle-lit bedroom—you can get pregnant!

"
What should I do if my birth control changes my mood?,"If you feel like your birth control is changing your behavior, it’s time to talk to your health care provider. Everybody responds to birth control differently, and your provider can help you decide whether it’s time to try something else. It might be a matter of switching hormonal methods or deciding whether to avoid hormonal birth control altogether, or you may choose to wait it out since some negative side effects go away with time. The bottom line: If your current method is making you feel blah, don’t settle. There are a lot of methods to choose from and sometimes it can take a few tries to get it right."
What’s wrong with using expired condoms?,"Just like milk, condoms can go bad… And when they do, they can break more easily. That’s why you should always check the condom’s expiration date and give the wrapper a thorough inspection before opening it.

Heat, sun, moisture, and fluorescent light can also make condoms more likely to break. To reduce the risk of breakage, store your condoms in a cool, dry place."
Can I use tampons or a menstrual cup with the ring?,"Tampons and menstrual cups do not interfere with the ring’s effectiveness. If your ring is in when you remove your tampon or cup, you might pull it out a bit, which might be annoying if it happens a lot.

When inserting your tampon or cup, make sure that your ring is all the way in first, and then position the tampon or cup afterwards. If you do end up pulling the ring out, you can rinse it in cool water and re-insert it right away."
How soon does an IUD become effective after you get it?,"The non-hormonal IUD is effective immediately after it’s inserted. The hormonal IUD is effective immediately if you get it inserted within 7 days of the start of your period. Otherwise it takes a little longer to become effective, so you should use a back-up method, such as condoms or internal condoms, for 7 days after insertion.

"
What's the difference between typical use and perfect use?,"Typical use means how well the method works to prevent pregnancy when real people in real life use it, whereas perfect use means how well the method works when it’s being tested in a clinical trial by people who are following the instructions perfectly every time for a whole year A perfect use effectiveness rate of 99%, for example, would mean that over the course of a year, on average, 1 out of 100 people using this method exactly as instructed will get pregnant.

Since life isn’t a clinical trial, we recommend paying closer attention to typical use numbers. But you can get closer to the perfect use number by learning to use your method correctly and consistently.

Some methods, like the IUD and implant, have a typical use rate that is super close to their perfect use rate—that’s because there’s very little room for error since there’s nothing to do or remember besides getting it switched out for a new one when it’s time. Other methods, like condoms, have a bigger difference between their typical use rate and perfect use rates, because there’s lots more room for error when using these methods.

"
How soon does the implant start working?,"The implant is effective right away if you get it during the first 5 days of your period. Otherwise use a back-up method for the first 7 days after you get it inserted.

"
I heard the IUD is really expensive—how much does it cost?,"It’s true that the up-front cost of an IUD can be high depending on your insurance, but even paying full price it ends up being pretty cheap considering how long it lasts. Mirena IUD can stay in your body for up to five years, costing you the equivalent of just $9 a month if you pay full price. The Paragard IUD can stay in your body for up to 10 years, costing you the equivalent of just $4 a month if you pay full price.
 
If you’re on Medicaid or have private insurance, the IUD might be free for you, or at least very cheap, since Medicaid and private insurance often pay for birth control.
 
If those aren’t options for you, check with the family planning clinics around you and find out if they offer discounts or payment plans for IUDs.
 
Check out our IUD page for more information about the cost of the IUD. "
Can I get pregnant if I've had endometrial ablation?,"In short, yes.

While pregnancy’s not likely — and not recommended — after ablation, it can happen, so women who have had an endometrial ablation (a.k.a. uterine ablation) should use birth control until after menopause. While it may be possible to get pregnant after this procedure, pregnancy after endometrial ablation can be complicated, so you shouldn’t get the procedure unless you’re sure you don’t want (more) kids. Sterilization may be a good option if you’ve had an endometrial ablation to make sure you never have to worry about an unplanned pregnancy."
Can I get pregnant from sex toys?,"Only if the sex toys had semen on them. You can only get pregnant if sperm enters your vagina. If semen is on a sex toy and it enters your vagina, you can become pregnant.

"
Is there anything that helps with IUD insertion pain?,"IUD insertion pain can vary from person to person, but unfortunately there isn’t a great drug to take to make insertion less painful.

You can try taking ibuprofen beforehand, and make sure you get the IUD inserted when your cervix is open, such as when you’re on your period or ovulating. Even if there is some pain, it might be worth it for years of worry-free boot knocking."
Can I take the morning-after pill at night?,"Yes. You can take emergency contraception pills (the morning-after pill) at any time of day for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. For emergency contraception pills like Plan B One-Step, Next Choice, Next Choice One Dose, and Levonorgestrel, the sooner you take them more effective they are. The emergency contraceptive pill ella doesn’t decrease in effectiveness over those 5 days.

"
How long until the ring starts working?,"The ring is effective seven days after you start using it, so be sure to use backup method, like a condom or internal condom, until then.

"
How can I avoid nausea as a side effect of taking emergency contraception?,"To prevent nausea and vomiting, you can take the non-prescription anti-nausea medicine meclizine (also sold under the brand names Dramamine II or Bonine) an hour before taking the first dose of EC. Note that this might make you drowsy.

If you end up puking within an hour of taking a dose of EC, you may want to take that dose again in case your body didn’t absorb the hormones yet."
Can I swim or take a shower while I’m wearing the patch?,"Yes, you sure can. It’s really rare that the patch falls off.

"
Can having diarrhea make the pill less effective?,"Having “loose” poop every now and then probably won’t affect how well your pill works, but severe diarrhea (eg. if you have it several times in one day) might. If you rely on the pill for birth control and you have severe diarrhea, it’s a good idea to use a backup method like condoms if you have sex while you’re sick or in the 7 days after you recover.

Still not working?

Common things like forgetting to take a pill or throwing up right after taking one are part of why the pill has a 9% failure rate. If that sounds too risky to you, you can double up with condoms or switch to a lower maintenance method."
Can the ring get lost in my vagina?,"No. The vagina is a closed pouch and doesn’t connect to the rest of the belly, so things (other than semen, bacteria, and other really, really, really small things) put in the vagina can’t travel to some other part of the body. There is no place for a tampon or a ring to go—they just sit right where you put them.

"
Why do I get sick more often when I’m on my period?,"Scientists have found that changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle can affect a woman’s stress response and immune system function. In addition, research has shown that women with immune system disorders (like allergies, asthma, and lupus) may experience an increase in symptoms during the luteal phase (21 – 23rd days) of their cycle.

"
What if I'm allergic to latex condoms or my partner is?,"Latex allergies are rare, but they happen. If you or your partner are allergic to latex, there are non-latex polyurethane condoms you can use to protect against pregnancy and STIs. Lambskin condoms are another option for preventing pregnancy, but they don’t protect against STIs.

"
Can my partner feel the diaphragm?,"Most men are not able to feel the diaphragm. Some men may feel it during intercourse, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable for either of you if this is the case.

"
Can ibuprofen help reduce heavy periods and irregular bleeding?,"Yes. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, like naproxen, can decrease menstrual flow and cramping. So if you have heavy or painful periods, your health care provider may recommend taking ibuprofen to help reduce heavy flow and/or cramping. It can also help reduce the irregular bleeding that is sometimes a side effect of progestin-only birth control methods like the shot or the implant."
What are some signs a guy is about to come?,"Everyone is different, so there are no universal signals to look out for. Communicating with your partner will help. If you want to use withdrawal for birth control but your partner is unsure what his signals are, practice with a condom first, or it might be fun to mess around without penetrative sex to learn his “I’m getting close” quirks.

Still not working?

Still not working?

If you don’t want to get pregnant now and your guy isn’t a pro at pulling out, you may want to use a more effective method. A few that don’t require an action in the moment are the IUD, the implant, and the shot. Double up with a condom for STI protection."
Can the IUD perforate your uterus during insertion?,"For about 1 in 2,000 women, the IUD can get stuck in or puncture the uterus—also known as perforation. Perforation only happens when the IUD is being put in. Highly skilled providers who have inserted many IUDs are less likely to have perforations. Women who are breastfeeding or have given birth within the last month are more likely to experience perforations because the muscle of the uterus is softer at those times.

What does it mean if there is a perforation? If it’s recognized immediately, the health care provider will stop the insertion. It takes about a week for the uterus to heal, and then a woman can have another IUD inserted if she wants. More than half of perforations may go unrecognized at the time of insertion. That may mean that a woman thought she had great birth control when she may not have. If undiagnosed for months, a perforation can make removing the IUD difficult, and can sometimes require surgery. Even in the worst-case scenario of an undiagnosed perforation that requires surgery, it shouldn’t have an impact on the woman’s future fertility."
What if I've lost my sex drive while on the shot?,"First, figure out if there’s other stuff going on in your life that could be causing you to lose your sex drive. Like, are you stressed? Or having relationship issues? You might want to try exercising more, therapy, or changing things up in the bedroom.

Still not working?

If you’ve looked at other things in your life that might cause the loss of sex drive and are still pretty sure it’s the shot, think about switching to the pill, the patch, or the ring (which have less hormone and are easier to stop if the problem persists) or an IUD (which has low or no hormones). You could also try non-hormonal methods such as the diaphragm, male condoms, or female condoms."
Can drinking alcohol affect my birth control?,"Whether alcohol affects your birth control really depends on what method you’re using. If you rely on birth control that requires you to use it before you have sex, like condoms or a diaphragm, then alcohol may make it harder for you to use your method correctly or to remember or to use it at all. Here’s more detail about how alcohol can affect sex and birth control.

BTW, if you’re interested a party-ready method, we’ve got you covered."
"I'm using the implant. Are the side effects like feeling moody, bloated, and nervous going to go away?","If the implant is new to you (that means 6 months or less) and the side effects are bearable, give it a little more time—hormone levels will start to level off, so those hormonal side effects tend to go away.

Still not working?

If you’ve given it at least six months and the side effects are still bothering you, consider trying a shorter-acting, lower-dose method, such as the pill, the patch, or the ring. You could also try either IUD."
Does alcohol reduce the effectiveness of birth control?,"Drinking doesn’t change the effectiveness of birth control, but it can impact your ability to use your method correctly. If you use condoms, spermicide, or a diaphragm—any method that requires set up right before sex—there is always a chance of human error. When you’re drunk, the chance of using these methods improperly goes up.

Still not working?

If you’re worried about messing up your birth control when you’re drinking, you may want to look into methods you don’t need to deal with in the moment."
